Designed home page template (by me) using Adobe XD. --> https://xd.adobe.com/view/84415020-3b64-4d7f-bbb8-9d90f3016370-d112/

This is my portfolio website, and my experience learning Git and GitHub.

Update on March 2:
Successfully learned how to connect a workflow to GitHub using repository secrets to be able to deploy repository updates directly to host for publishing via FTP.
